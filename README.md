Why Antivirus Must Be Off

Nova Court is a Roblox executor that modifies game memory to run scripts. Antivirus software often flags these kinds of programs as false positives because they perform actions similar to malware (memory injection, script execution). No personal data is collected, and the program is safe to use if downloaded from the official link. Temporarily disabling AV allows Nova Court to run without interference. Always re-enable your antivirus after use.


⚠️ Make sure Roblox is fully loaded before attaching.
✅ Only download from official links.
